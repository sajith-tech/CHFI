# Computer Forensics: Basic Notes

## 1. Introduction to Computer Forensics

- **Definition**: Computer forensics involves collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence for legal investigations.
- **Objective**: To identify, recover, analyze, and present digital evidence in a way that is legally admissible.
- **Applications**: Cybercrime investigations, corporate fraud detection, and data recovery.

## 2. Key Concepts

- **Digital Evidence**: Any data stored or transmitted using a computer that can support investigations.
- **Chain of Custody**: Maintaining a record of who handled the evidence to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
- **Write-Blocking**: Preventing any changes to evidence while analyzing it.

## 3. Types of Digital Evidence

- **Hard Drives**: Contain files, logs, and other data.
- **Email and Communication Logs**: Record exchanges of messages.
- **Internet History**: Tracks user activity online.
- **Mobile Devices**: Include calls, texts, and app data.
- **Cloud Storage**: Data hosted on platforms like Google Drive or Dropbox.

## 4. Computer Forensics Process

1. **Identification**: Determine potential sources of digital evidence.
2. **Preservation**: Secure the evidence to prevent modification.
3. **Analysis**: Examine the evidence for useful information.
4. **Documentation**: Record findings systematically.
5. **Presentation**: Deliver evidence in court or to stakeholders.

## 5. Tools in Computer Forensics

- **FTK (Forensic Toolkit)**: A tool for processing and analyzing data.
- **EnCase**: Used for imaging and analyzing evidence.
- **Autopsy**: An open-source forensic tool.
