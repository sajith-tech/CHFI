# Dark Web Forensics

## What is the Dark Web?
The **Dark Web** is a hidden part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines like Google. It can only be accessed using special software like **Tor (The Onion Router)**. It is often used for privacy-focused activities but also for illegal activities like cybercrime, drug trafficking, and data breaches.

## What is Dark Web Forensics?
**Dark Web Forensics** is the process of investigating activities on the Dark Web to track criminals, gather evidence, and analyze cyber threats.

## Steps in Dark Web Forensics

### 1. Accessing the Dark Web
- Use **Tor Browser** to explore the Dark Web safely.
- Use a **VPN** and **isolated environment (like a virtual machine)** to avoid risks.

### 2. Identifying Illegal Activities
- Monitor forums, marketplaces, and chat rooms for illegal activities.
- Look for stolen data, malware sales, and criminal communications.

### 3. Collecting Evidence
- Use **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** techniques to track user activity.
- Save **screenshots, transaction logs, and website metadata** as evidence.
- Extract information from **Bitcoin transactions** and blockchain analysis.

### 4. Analyzing Data
- Inspect **Tor network traffic** to trace communication patterns.
- Use **dark web crawlers** to index hidden websites.
- Perform **link analysis** to find connections between criminals.

### 5. Legal Considerations
- Always follow **legal procedures** when collecting evidence.
- Work with **law enforcement agencies** to handle cases properly.

## Tools for Dark Web Forensics
- **Tor Browser** - Accesses .onion websites.
- **ExifTool** - Extracts metadata from dark web images.
- **Wireshark** - Analyzes network traffic for dark web activity.
- **Bitcoin Explorer** - Traces cryptocurrency transactions.
- **Hunchly** - Captures web pages as forensic evidence.

## Challenges in Dark Web Forensics
- **Anonymity** - Users on the Dark Web hide their identity.
- **Encryption** - Communication is highly encrypted, making analysis difficult.
- **Jurisdiction Issues** - Criminals operate across different countries, making legal action complex.

## Conclusion
Dark Web Forensics helps investigators track cybercriminals and gather evidence of illegal activities. By using specialized tools and techniques, forensic experts can analyze hidden online threats while ensuring they follow legal guidelines.
