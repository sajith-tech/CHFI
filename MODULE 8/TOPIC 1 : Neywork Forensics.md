# Network Forensics

## Introduction
Network forensics is a branch of digital forensics that focuses on monitoring, capturing, and analyzing network traffic to gather evidence and detect cybercrimes.

## Importance of Network Forensics
- Helps in identifying cyber threats and attacks.
- Assists in tracking malicious activities.
- Provides evidence for legal investigations.
- Ensures compliance with security policies.
- Helps in identifying vulnerabilities in a network.

## Key Concepts
### 1. **Network Traffic Analysis**
   - Monitoring data packets transferred over a network.
   - Identifying suspicious activities.

### 2. **Packet Capture**
   - Using tools to record network traffic.
   - Example tools: Wireshark, tcpdump.

### 3. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**
   - Identifying unauthorized access.
   - Example tools: Snort, Suricata.

### 4. **Log Analysis**
   - Reviewing firewall, router, and server logs.
   - Detecting anomalies and suspicious patterns.

### 5. **Malware Analysis**
   - Detecting malicious software in network traffic.
   - Understanding attack methodologies.

## Network Forensics Process
1. **Identification**
   - Detecting a security incident or anomaly.
   
2. **Collection**
   - Capturing network traffic and logs.
   - Ensuring data integrity.
   
3. **Preservation**
   - Storing data securely to prevent tampering.
   - Using cryptographic hashing for verification.
   
4. **Analysis**
   - Examining logs, packets, and anomalies.
   - Identifying attack sources and methods.
   
5. **Reporting**
   - Documenting findings in a structured format.
   - Providing evidence for legal or security teams.
   
6. **Response**
   - Taking actions to mitigate threats.
   - Strengthening security measures.

## Common Network Attacks Investigated
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: Overloading a network to make it unavailable.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Intercepting communications between two parties.
- **Phishing Attacks**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive data.
- **Ransomware Attacks**: Encrypting data and demanding payment.
- **SQL Injection**: Exploiting database vulnerabilities.

## Network Forensics Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Wireshark | Packet capturing and analysis |
| tcpdump | Command-line packet analyzer |
| Snort | Intrusion detection and prevention |
| Suricata | Network monitoring and security |
| Zeek (Bro) | Network security monitoring |
| ELK Stack | Log analysis and visualization |

## Best Practices in Network Forensics
- **Enable logging**: Keep detailed logs of network activities.
- **Use encrypted communication**: Prevent unauthorized access.
- **Regular network monitoring**: Detect threats early.
- **Implement firewalls and IDS/IPS**: Protect against attacks.
- **Train employees**: Educate staff on cybersecurity risks.
- **Follow legal and ethical guidelines**: Ensure compliance with regulations.

## Conclusion
Network forensics is essential for investigating and preventing cyber threats. By using the right tools and techniques, forensic experts can identify security breaches, gather evidence, and enhance network security.
