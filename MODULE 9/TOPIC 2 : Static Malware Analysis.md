# Static Malware Analysis

## What is Static Malware Analysis?
Static malware analysis is the process of examining a malicious file **without executing it**. It helps analysts gather information about the malware’s structure, behavior, and potential threats in a safe manner.

---

## Why is Static Analysis Important?
- **Safe approach** – No need to execute the malware.
- **Quick detection** – Identifies known malware patterns.
- **Code insights** – Helps in understanding the malware’s purpose.
- **Indicator Extraction** – Extracts hashes, strings, and signatures for detection.

## Steps in Static Malware Analysis
### 1. **File Identification**
   - Determine the file type (**EXE, DLL, PDF, etc.**)
   - Check hashes (**MD5, SHA256**) to see if it’s known malware (use **VirusTotal**).
   
### 2. **String Analysis**
   - Extract readable strings using tools like **strings**.
   - Look for suspicious keywords like URLs, IPs, registry keys, or commands.

### 3. **File Structure Analysis**
   - Examine file headers and sections (**PE header for Windows executables**).
   - Use tools like **PEiD, Exeinfo PE** to detect packing or obfuscation.

### 4. **Disassembly & Reverse Engineering**
   - Convert machine code into human-readable assembly.
   - Use **IDA Pro, Ghidra, or Radare2** to analyze code without executing it.

### 5. **Signature-based Detection**
   - Compare against known malware signatures (**YARA rules**).
   - Detect embedded shellcode or encryption patterns.

### 6. **Entropy Analysis**
   - High entropy may indicate **packed or encrypted malware**.
   - Tools: **Binwalk, PE Studio**.

### 7. **Embedded Resource Extraction**
   - Extract and analyze **icons, images, embedded executables**.
   - Tools: **Resource Hacker, HxD Hex Editor**.

## Tools for Static Malware Analysis
1. **strings** – Extracts readable text from binaries.
2. **PE Studio** – Examines PE file structure and entropy.
3. **IDA Pro / Ghidra** – Advanced disassembly and reverse engineering.
4. **YARA** – Pattern matching for malware detection.
5. **Binwalk** – Extracts embedded files from binaries.
6. **VirusTotal** – Checks file reputation against antivirus databases.

## Limitations of Static Analysis
- **Cannot detect runtime behavior** (e.g., dynamic code execution).
- **Obfuscated malware** may hide its true intent.
- **Packed or encrypted files** require additional unpacking techniques.

## Conclusion
Static malware analysis is a crucial first step in investigating malware. It provides **quick insights** into the file’s characteristics, helping analysts decide whether further dynamic analysis is needed.
