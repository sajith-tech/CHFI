# Ransomware Analysis in Malware Forensics

## What is Ransomware?
Ransomware is a type of **malicious software** that encrypts files or locks a system, demanding a ransom payment for decryption. It is a significant cyber threat that targets individuals, businesses, and critical infrastructure.

## Why Analyze Ransomware?
- **Understand the attack methodology.**
- **Identify the encryption mechanism used.**
- **Determine the infection vector (phishing, exploit kits, etc.).**
- **Find possible decryption or mitigation techniques.**
- **Extract indicators of compromise (IoCs) for threat intelligence.**

---

## Steps for Ransomware Analysis
### 1. **Setting Up a Secure Analysis Environment**
   - Use **isolated sandboxes or virtual machines**.
   - Block internet access to prevent communication with command-and-control (C2) servers.
   - Utilize forensic tools to capture system changes.

### 2. **Static Analysis of Ransomware Sample**
   - Identify file type (EXE, DLL, script, etc.).
   - Examine PE headers and strings for URLs, encryption methods, and ransom notes.
   - Use tools like **PEStudio, Exeinfo PE, Strings, VirusTotal**.

### 3. **Dynamic Analysis (Behavioral Analysis)**
   - Execute the ransomware in a controlled environment to observe:
     - **File encryption process.**
     - **Registry modifications.**
     - **Network communication with C2 servers.**
   - Use tools like **Process Monitor, Process Explorer, Wireshark, FakeNet-NG**.

### 4. **Identifying Encryption Mechanisms**
   - Analyze file modifications before and after execution.
   - Identify encryption algorithms (AES, RSA, XOR, etc.).
   - Look for ransom note creation and file extensions.
   - Use **IDA Pro, Ghidra, x64dbg** for deeper analysis.

### 5. **Analyzing Network Behavior**
   - Capture **outgoing network requests** for C2 communication.
   - Identify ransom payment instructions (TOR, Bitcoin addresses, etc.).
   - Use tools like **Wireshark, Snort, Zeek (Bro)**.

### 6. **Extracting Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**
   - Collect **malicious file hashes (MD5, SHA256)**.
   - Identify **domains and IP addresses used by ransomware.**
   - Extract **registry keys and file paths for forensic investigation.**
   - Submit IoCs to threat intelligence platforms (VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis).

### 7. **Attempting Decryption or Mitigation**
   - Search for publicly available decryption tools (e.g., **NoMoreRansom**).
   - Identify weaknesses in encryption implementation.
   - Restore from backups if available.
   - Use **ransomware-specific decryptors** when possible.

## Best Practices for Ransomware Forensics
- **Always analyze ransomware in an isolated environment.**
- **Backup critical data regularly to prevent loss.**
- **Monitor network traffic for unusual encryption-related activities.**
- **Educate users on phishing and social engineering attacks.**
- **Use threat intelligence to stay updated on emerging ransomware variants.**

## Conclusion
Ransomware analysis is crucial in **understanding, mitigating, and preventing ransomware attacks**. By using forensic techniques, security analysts can detect encryption methods, identify IoCs, and contribute to global threat intelligence efforts. Proper analysis helps in developing **better defenses against future ransomware attacks**.
