# Practical Guide: Emotet Malware Analysis

## 1. Setting Up a Secure Analysis Environment
To safely analyze Emotet, use an **isolated malware analysis lab**:
- Install **REMnux** or **FLARE VM** on a **Virtual Machine (VM)**.
- Disable internet access to prevent communication with Command & Control (C2) servers.
- Use **snapshots** to restore the system if needed.
- Use **FakeNet-NG** to simulate network activity for analysis.

## 2. Open-Source Tools for Emotet Analysis
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **oletools (oleid, olevba)** | Extract macros from malicious Word documents |
| **pdf-parser.py** | Analyze embedded links in PDFs |
| **YARA** | Detect malware patterns in files |
| **ProcMon** | Monitor suspicious process activity |
| **Wireshark** | Capture network traffic generated by Emotet |
| **Strings** | Extract readable text from executables |
| **PEStudio** | Analyze PE structure of Emotet executables |

## 3. Analyzing Emotet Delivery Mechanism (Malicious Documents)
### **Step 1: Identify Suspicious Macros in Word Documents**
```bash
oleid sample.doc
```
- Check if the document contains **VBA macros, OLE objects, or suspicious links**.

### **Step 2: Extract and Analyze Macros**
```bash
olevba sample.doc
```
- Look for **AutoOpen macros, obfuscation, and PowerShell execution commands**.

### **Step 3: Decode Obfuscated VBA Code**
```bash
olevba -a sample.doc
```
- Identify attempts to download Emotet payloads.

## 4. Analyzing Emotet Executable Payload
### **Step 1: Extract Strings from the Executable**
```bash
strings sample.exe | less
```
- Look for **URLs, IP addresses, registry modifications, or encoded commands**.

### **Step 2: Check PE Headers and Imports**
```bash
pestudio sample.exe
```
- Identify **anti-analysis techniques, suspicious imports, and packers**.

### **Step 3: Monitor Process Behavior with ProcMon**
- Track registry modifications and spawned processes when executed.

### **Step 4: Capture Network Traffic with Wireshark**
- Look for **HTTP requests to known Emotet C2 servers**.

```bash
tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "http.request"
```

## 5. Practical Exercise for Students
1. **Set up a VM** with REMnux or FLARE VM.
2. **Obtain a test Emotet sample** from MalwareBazaar.
3. **Analyze a malicious document** using **oletools**.
4. **Extract macros and PowerShell scripts** for manual analysis.
5. **Execute the Emotet sample in a controlled environment** and monitor process behavior.
6. **Use Wireshark to capture network requests** and analyze C2 communication.

## 6. Conclusion
Emotet is a highly modular and evasive malware. By leveraging open-source tools, students can learn how to detect, analyze, and mitigate its impact. Practical exercises will help in understanding real-world malware analysis techniques.
