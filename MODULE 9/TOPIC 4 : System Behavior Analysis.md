# System Behavior Analysis in Malware Forensics

## What is System Behavior Analysis?
System behavior analysis involves **monitoring how malware interacts with the operating system** during execution. This includes tracking **process creation, file modifications, registry changes, network activity, and memory usage** to understand the malware's impact.

---

## Why Perform System Behavior Analysis?
- **Detects runtime changes made by malware.**
- **Identifies persistence mechanisms** used by malware.
- **Reveals network communication** with command-and-control (C2) servers.
- **Helps in detecting file system modifications** and dropped payloads.

## Steps for System Behavior Analysis
### 1. **Setting Up an Isolated Environment**
   - Use **sandboxing solutions** (e.g., Any.Run, Cuckoo Sandbox, Hybrid Analysis).
   - Utilize **virtual machines (VMs) with snapshots** to revert changes.

### 2. **Process Monitoring**
   - Observe running processes before and after malware execution.
   - Tools: **Process Explorer, Process Monitor (Procmon)**.

### 3. **File System Analysis**
   - Check for newly created, modified, or deleted files.
   - Monitor for dropped executables and temporary files.
   - Tools: **Procmon, OSForensics, Sysinternals Suite**.

### 4. **Registry Activity Monitoring**
   - Detects **registry key modifications** related to persistence.
   - Tools: **Regshot, Autoruns, Procmon**.

### 5. **Network Traffic Analysis**
   - Identifies C2 communication, DNS lookups, and data exfiltration.
   - Tools: **Wireshark, TCPView, Fakenet-NG**.

### 6. **Memory Analysis**
   - Extracts **injected code, encryption keys, or shellcode**.
   - Tools: **Volatility, Rekall, Memoryze**.

### 7. **Detecting Anti-Analysis Techniques**
   - Check for malware detecting virtual environments or debugging tools.
   - Use **API monitoring tools** like **x64dbg, OllyDbg**.

## Tools for System Behavior Analysis
1. **Cuckoo Sandbox** – Automated malware behavior analysis.
2. **Process Monitor (Procmon)** – Tracks system calls and file modifications.
3. **Wireshark** – Captures and analyzes network traffic.
4. **Autoruns** – Detects persistence mechanisms.
5. **Regshot** – Compares registry changes.
6. **Volatility** – Analyzes memory dumps.

## Best Practices for System Behavior Analysis
- **Use a dedicated analysis environment (VMs, sandboxes).**
- **Disable internet access to prevent real-world impact.**
- **Monitor logs and system changes continuously.**
- **Automate analysis using scripts or security tools.**

## Conclusion
System behavior analysis is a critical part of **malware forensics**, helping investigators understand malware execution, identify persistence techniques, and detect network-based threats. Proper monitoring tools and techniques ensure effective detection and mitigation of malware infections.
