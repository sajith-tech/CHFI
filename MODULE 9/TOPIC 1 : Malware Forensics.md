# Malware Forensics

## What is Malware Forensics?
Malware forensics is the process of analyzing, identifying, and investigating malicious software (malware) to understand its impact, origin, and functionality. It helps cybersecurity professionals detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats.

## Types of Malware
1. **Virus** - Attaches to files and spreads when executed.
2. **Worm** - Spreads automatically without user interaction.
3. **Trojan Horse** - Disguised as legitimate software.
4. **Ransomware** - Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption.
5. **Spyware** - Secretly collects user information.
6. **Adware** - Displays unwanted advertisements.
7. **Rootkits** - Hides malicious activity and grants unauthorized access.
8. **Botnets** - A network of infected devices controlled remotely.

## Steps in Malware Forensics
### 1. **Identification**
   - Detect suspicious activity or files.
   - Use antivirus tools and logs for initial analysis.

### 2. **Collection**
   - Acquire infected system memory (RAM dump).
   - Extract malicious files and logs.

### 3. **Static Analysis** (Without Executing Malware)
   - Check file properties (e.g., hash values, metadata).
   - Use tools like **strings, PEiD, Hex editors**.
   
### 4. **Dynamic Analysis** (Executing Malware in a Safe Environment)
   - Run malware in a sandbox.
   - Observe its behavior, network connections, and system modifications.

### 5. **Reverse Engineering**
   - Decompile or debug the malware.
   - Use tools like **IDA Pro, Ghidra, OllyDbg**.

### 6. **Detection & Mitigation**
   - Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
   - Remove malware and strengthen security defenses.

## Tools Used in Malware Forensics
1. **Wireshark** - Captures network traffic.
2. **Volatility** - Analyzes memory dumps.
3. **YARA** - Helps in pattern-based detection.
4. **Cuckoo Sandbox** - Runs malware in an isolated environment.
5. **Sysinternals Suite** - Monitors Windows processes and registry changes.
6. **VirusTotal** - Scans files with multiple antivirus engines.

## Best Practices
- Always use a **sandboxed** or **isolated environment** for analysis.
- Maintain proper **chain of custody** when collecting malware evidence.
- Regularly update **antivirus and security tools**.
- Educate users on **phishing attacks** and suspicious downloads.
- Monitor **network traffic** for unusual activity.

## Conclusion
Malware forensics is crucial for identifying and mitigating cyber threats. By understanding how malware works and using the right tools, cybersecurity professionals can effectively investigate and prevent future attacks.
