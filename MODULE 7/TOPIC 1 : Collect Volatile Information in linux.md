# Collecting Volatile Information in Linux

Volatile information refers to data that is lost when a system is powered off. Collecting this data is crucial in forensic investigations and incident response.

## 1. Checking System Uptime
To check how long the system has been running:
```bash
uptime
who -b  # Shows the last system boot time
```

## 2. Logged-In Users
To list currently logged-in users:
```bash
who
w
```

## 3. Running Processes
To see all active processes:
```bash
ps aux
```
For a real-time process view:
```bash
top
htop  # If installed, provides an interactive view
```

## 4. Open Network Connections
To check active network connections:
```bash
netstat -tulnp
ss -tulnp  # Alternative command
```

## 5. Network Interfaces and Configuration
To get network interface details:
```bash
ifconfig  # Older systems
ip a      # Newer systems
```

## 6. ARP Cache
To view the ARP table:
```bash
arp -a
ip neigh  # Alternative command
```

## 7. Open Files
To list files opened by running processes:
```bash
lsof
```

## 8. System Logs
To check recent logs:
```bash
dmesg | tail -50  # Kernel logs
journalctl -n 50  # System logs (for systemd systems)
```

## 9. Environment Variables
To list environment variables:
```bash
env
printenv
```

## 10. User and Group Information
To get user details:
```bash
id
whoami
cat /etc/passwd  # List all users
```
To get group details:
```bash
group
cat /etc/group  # List all groups
```

## 11. Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs
To check scheduled tasks:
```bash
crontab -l  # User cron jobs
ls -la /etc/cron*  # System cron jobs
```

## 12. Active Kernel Modules
To list loaded kernel modules:
```bash
lsmod
```

## 13. Mounted File Systems
To list mounted file systems:
```bash
mount
lsblk
```

## 14. Memory Usage
To check memory details:
```bash
free -m
cat /proc/meminfo
```

## 15. Disk Usage
To check disk space:
```bash
df -h
```
To see detailed disk usage:
```bash
du -sh /*
```

## 16. Command History
To view the command history:
```bash
history
cat ~/.bash_history  # User command history
```

## Conclusion
Collecting volatile data quickly is essential in forensic investigations. Using the above commands, you can gather critical system information before it is lost.
