# Linux File System

## 1. Introduction to Linux File System
The Linux file system organizes and stores data hierarchically in directories and files. It provides a standard structure for handling file storage, access permissions, and organization.

---

## 2. Structure of Linux File System
- **Root Directory (`/`)**: The topmost directory in Linux. All other directories and files are accessible from here.

### Common Directories under `/`
| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/bin`    | Essential binaries for system operations (e.g., `ls`, `cp`). |
| `/boot`   | Boot loader files (e.g., Linux kernel). |
| `/dev`    | Device files (e.g., `/dev/sda1`). |
| `/etc`    | Configuration files for system and applications. |
| `/home`   | User-specific directories and files. |
| `/lib`    | Shared libraries required by system programs. |
| `/media`  | Mount points for removable media like USB drives. |
| `/mnt`    | Temporary mount points for file systems. |
| `/opt`    | Optional software packages. |
| `/proc`   | Virtual filesystem with information about processes and kernel. |
| `/root`   | Home directory of the root user. |
| `/sbin`   | System binaries (e.g., administrative commands). |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files. |
| `/usr`    | User programs and utilities. |
| `/var`    | Variable files like logs (`/var/log`). |

## 3. Important Features of Linux File System
- **Case Sensitivity:** File and directory names are case-sensitive (`file.txt` â‰  `File.txt`).
- **File Permissions:** Controlled by read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) permissions for user (`u`), group (`g`), and others (`o`).
- **Mounting:** File systems need to be mounted before access.
- **Inodes:** Data structures that store metadata about files (not the file name).

## 4. Types of Linux File Systems
| File System | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **ext2**    | Early Linux filesystem; lacks journaling. |
| **ext3**    | Enhanced ext2 with journaling support. |
| **ext4**    | Modern Linux filesystem with large volume support and better performance. |
| **XFS**     | High-performance journaling filesystem for large data volumes. |
| **Btrfs**   | Advanced filesystem with snapshots and dynamic resizing. |
| **vfat**    | Used for compatibility with Windows systems. |
| **NTFS**    | Read-only support for Windows partitions in Linux. |

---

## 5. File Types in Linux
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Regular Files (`-`) | Normal files like text or binary data. |
| Directory (`d`) | Contains other files and directories. |
| Symbolic Links (`l`) | Pointers to other files or directories. |
| Block Devices (`b`) | Devices like hard drives. |
| Character Devices (`c`) | Devices that handle data character by character. |
| Named Pipes (`p`) | IPC mechanism for process communication. |
| Sockets (`s`) | Network-related files. |

---

## 6. File Permissions and Ownership
- **Permission Structure:**  
  `drwxr-xr-x`  
  - `d` indicates directory; `rwx` for user, group, and others.
- **Changing Permissions:**  
  - `chmod`: Modify file permissions (`chmod 755 file.txt`)
  - `chown`: Change file owner (`chown user:group file.txt`)

---

## 7. Mounting and Unmounting File Systems
- **Mounting:**  
  `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt`
- **Unmounting:**  
  `umount /mnt`

---

## 8. Managing Disk Partitions
- **Tools:**  
  - `fdisk`: Partition management tool.
  - `df`: Show disk usage (`df -h`).
  - `du`: Show directory sizes (`du -sh /path`).
  - `lsblk`: Display block devices.

---

## 9. File System Integrity and Maintenance
- **Checking Disk Errors:**  
  `fsck /dev/sda1`
- **Creating File Systems:**  
  `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1`
- **Resizing File Systems:**  
  `resize2fs /dev/sda1`

---

## 10. Advanced Concepts
- **Journaling:** Keeps track of changes to files before committing them to the main file system to prevent corruption.
- **Swap Space:** Temporary storage used by the OS when RAM is full.
- **Logical Volume Manager (LVM):** Allows flexible disk management.
- **Snapshots:** Captures the state of a filesystem at a given point in time.

## 11. Useful Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ls`    | List files and directories. |
| `cd`    | Change directory. |
| `pwd`   | Show current directory. |
| `find`  | Search for files and directories. |
| `df -h` | Display disk usage. |
| `mount` | Mount a file system. |
| `umount`| Unmount a file system. |
| `fsck`  | Check and repair filesystem. |
| `du -sh`| Show directory size. |

## 12. Conclusion
The Linux file system is robust, hierarchical, and highly customizable, providing an efficient way to manage data storage and access. Understanding its structure, file types, and commands is crucial for effective system administration and troubleshooting.
