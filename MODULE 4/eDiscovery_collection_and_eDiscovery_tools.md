## eDiscovery Collection Methodologies

### 1. **Identification**
This step involves determining the sources of relevant electronic data, such as:
- Emails
- Databases
- Shared drives
- Cloud storage
- End-user devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones)

**Best Practices:**
- Conduct interviews with key personnel to identify potential data sources.
- Develop a data map to document storage locations.

### 2. **Preservation**
Preservation ensures that electronic data remains intact and unaltered. Failure to preserve evidence can lead to legal consequences.

**Key Techniques:**
- Implement legal holds.
- Use write blockers for physical media.
- Ensure chain-of-custody documentation.

### 3. **Collection**
The collection process involves gathering electronic data in a manner that maintains its integrity.

**Types of Collection:**
- **Targeted Collection:** Focuses on specific files and data sets.
- **Full Disk Imaging:** Captures a complete copy of the storage device.

**Best Practices:**
- Use forensically sound tools.
- Verify data integrity using hashing algorithms.
- Avoid altering metadata.

### 4. **Processing**
Data processing includes filtering, deduplication, and indexing to reduce the volume of data for review.

**Common Steps:**
- Remove duplicate files.
- Convert proprietary formats to readable ones.

### 5. **Review**
Review involves examining the collected data for relevance to the case or investigation.

**Tools Used:**
- Document review platforms (Relativity, Everlaw)
- Keyword searching and tagging

### 6. **Production**
The final phase involves producing the relevant data for legal or investigative use.

**Formats:**
- Native format
- PDF/TIFF images
- Load files for legal review platforms
