# Creating a Forensic Image for Examination and Converting it to Various Supportive Formats

## **Introduction**
Creating a forensic image is a fundamental step in digital forensics that involves capturing an exact bit-by-bit copy of digital storage media. This ensures data integrity and allows forensic investigators to work on an accurate replica without altering the original evidence.

---

## **Objectives**
- Understand the purpose and types of forensic imaging.
- Learn practical steps for creating forensic images.
- Convert forensic images into different formats for data acquisition.

---

## **Types of Forensic Images**
1. **Raw Image (.dd)**: Exact bit-by-bit copy of the source.
2. **E01 (EnCase Evidence File)**: Compressed and metadata-supported image.
3. **AFF (Advanced Forensic Format)**: Open-source and metadata-rich.

---

## **Tools Required**
- **Kali Linux** (pre-installed with forensic tools)
- **FTK Imager**
- **dd command**
- **Guymager**
- **AccessData FTK** (Windows)
- Write blockers (optional but recommended)

## **Practical Steps to Create a Forensic Image**

### **1. Using `dd` Command in Linux**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide:**
1. Open the terminal on your forensic workstation.
2. Identify the target storage device using:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk -l
   ```
3. Create the forensic image:
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/path/to/output_image.dd bs=4M status=progress
   ```
   - Replace `/dev/sdX` with your target device.
   - Specify the output path and image name.

4. Verify the image integrity by generating a hash:
   ```bash
   sha256sum /path/to/output_image.dd
   ```

5. Document the hash value for chain-of-custody purposes.

### **2. Using Guymager (GUI Tool)**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide:**
1. Open Guymager from your forensic toolkit.
2. Select the target device.
3. Click **Acquire Image** and select the format (e.g., `dd`, `E01`).
4. Specify the destination path and image filename.
5. Start the acquisition and monitor the progress.
6. Verify the generated hash.

### **3. Using FTK Imager (Windows)**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide:**
1. Install and launch FTK Imager.
2. Go to **File > Create Disk Image**.
3. Select the source (physical drive or logical partition).
4. Choose the output format (`E01`, `dd`, etc.).
5. Specify the destination folder and file name.
6. Start the imaging process and verify the image.

## **Converting Forensic Images**

### **1. Converting Raw Image to E01 Format**
Use `ewfacquire` from the `libewf-tools` package:
```bash
sudo ewfacquire -i /path/to/source_image.dd -o /path/to/output_image.E01
```

### **2. Converting E01 to Raw Image**
```bash
sudo ewfexport -t raw -i /path/to/image.E01 -o /path/to/output_image.dd
```

### **3. Mounting Forensic Images for Analysis**
To mount a `dd` image:
```bash
sudo mount -o loop,ro /path/to/image.dd /mnt/forensic_mount
```

### **4. Verifying Data Integrity**
Generate hash values and compare:
```bash
sha256sum /path/to/image
```

---

## **Best Practices**
- Always use write blockers to prevent modification of the original media.
- Document the acquisition process, including timestamps and hash values.
- Maintain chain-of-custody documentation.
- Verify image integrity using multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).

---

## **Conclusion**
Creating a forensic image and converting it into various formats ensures the integrity and flexibility of digital evidence for forensic investigations. By following these practical steps and best practices, students can gain hands-on experience in professional data acquisition methodologies.
