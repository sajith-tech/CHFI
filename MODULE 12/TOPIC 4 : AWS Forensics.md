# AWS Fundamentals

## 1. Introduction to AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that provides on-demand computing resources, storage, databases, networking, and security services. It allows businesses and individuals to run applications and store data without maintaining physical hardware.

## 2. Benefits of AWS
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales resources based on demand.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model with no upfront cost.
- **Security**: Advanced security features like encryption and IAM policies.
- **Global Reach**: Data centers available worldwide for low-latency performance.
- **Reliability**: High availability with backup and disaster recovery solutions.

## 3. Key AWS Services
### a. Compute Services
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual servers in the cloud.
- **Lambda**: Serverless computing to run code without provisioning servers.
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Manages Docker containers.
- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Kubernetes-based container orchestration.

### b. Storage Services
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Scalable object storage.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Persistent storage for EC2 instances.
- **Glacier**: Long-term data archival storage.

### c. Networking Services
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolated cloud network for resources.
- **Route 53**: Domain name system (DNS) service.
- **CloudFront**: Content delivery network (CDN) for faster access.

### d. Database Services
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for high-performance applications.
- **ElastiCache**: In-memory caching for faster database performance.

### e. Security & Identity
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Controls user access and permissions.
- **AWS Shield**: DDoS protection.
- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Protects applications from web-based attacks.

### f. Monitoring & Management
- **CloudWatch**: Monitors AWS resources and logs events.
- **CloudTrail**: Tracks API calls and user activity.
- **AWS Config**: Monitors and records AWS resource configurations.

## 4. AWS Pricing Model
AWS follows a **Pay-as-you-go** pricing model with:
- **On-Demand**: Pay for what you use.
- **Reserved Instances**: Commit to long-term usage for discounts.
- **Spot Instances**: Use spare capacity at lower costs.
- **Free Tier**: Limited free usage for new users.

## 5. AWS Global Infrastructure
AWS operates in **Regions**, **Availability Zones (AZs)**, and **Edge Locations**:
- **Regions**: Physical locations worldwide (e.g., US-East, EU-West).
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Multiple isolated data centers within a region.
- **Edge Locations**: Used by CloudFront to deliver content faster.

## 6. Getting Started with AWS
### a. Creating an AWS Account
1. Visit [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com).
2. Click **Create an AWS Account** and enter details.
3. Choose a pricing plan (Free Tier available).
4. Set up billing and IAM users for security.

### b. Accessing AWS Services
- **AWS Management Console** (Web UI)
- **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**
- **AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits) for Python, Java, etc.**

## 7. Conclusion
AWS provides a powerful cloud platform for businesses, developers, and researchers. Understanding its fundamentals helps in deploying scalable, secure, and cost-effective applications.
